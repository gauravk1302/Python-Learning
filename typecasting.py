# example of type casting in python means it is done manually by user itself 
a,b=1,"2"# here second variable that is stored is string and it cannot be added directly to a value 
c=int(b)
print(a+c)# now string has been changed to int type user manually 
"""int (value)
float (value)
woh string jo mana hai woh int and float mein convert ho jayega phir opertion perform hoga"""
